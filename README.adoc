= Kmonad Template for Lenovo Legion

Created on the Legion 5i.
Should work with other Legion laptops with little to no configuration.

Includes full keyboard layout and 75ish layout.

75ish layout excludes numpad and arrow keys,
which is useful if you only want to re-map keys around the home row.

NOTE: `record` key does nothing.
Seems to be the XF86TouchpadOn button,
but Kmonad doesn't directly support X11 keys.
See FAQ.
Let me know with an issue if you figure out what key it is.
